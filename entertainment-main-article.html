                    The Oscar telecast always juggles three major objectives: Honoring the year’s best films and those who made them; broadly celebrating and promoting the movie-going habit; and putting on a good show, both for the bigwigs in the theater and the folks at home. </p> 
                <br>
                <p>The second one of those priorities has taken on greater significance amid a slump in theatrical ticket sales, victimized by a one-two punch from Covid and streaming. Yet the 96th Academy Awards shined the brightest in that third basket, delivering an award telecast defined by its playfulness and punctuated by moments of fun, with Ryan Gosling’s contributions worth the price of admission alone.</p>

                            Those qualities were both necessary and welcome, since the awards themselves followed the anticipated script, closing with the unsurprising act of handing the coveted best-picture prize to “Oppenheimer,” one of seven statuettes amassed by director Christopher Nolan’s historical epic.             
                            Indeed, the main challenge facing the producers hinged on the general lack of suspense regarding who would win in key categories other than best actress. That award went to Emma Stone for “Poor Things,” whose emotional acceptance somewhat compensated for the fact the choice deprived Lily Gladstone of what would have been a historic win.

                            Otherwise, the selections went according to form, recognizing those who had plenty of time to rehearse and fine-tune their acceptance speeches over the course of the awards season that began way back in early January.

                            <b>The acting testimonials.</b>  Having past winners introduce the nominees in the acting categories and give them a moment in the spotlight felt like a nice, warm reminder that it really is an honor just to be nominated. The only drawback was Da’Vine Joy Randolph, the night’s biggest sure thing, beginning to cry before she even heard her name called for “The Holdovers.” <br> <br> <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>He’s not just Ken. </b>In one of those rare instances of a telegraphed event that actually lived up to the anticipation and hype, Ryan Gosling crushed his performance of “I’m Just Ken” with gusto, after a truly amusing bit that involved him riffing on the “Barbenheimer” rivalry with Emily Blunt. He might be No. 2 to Barbie, but give Gosling this year’s Oscars MVP award.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            <b>Jimmy Kimmel.</b> While there’s nothing bold about using the Oscars to showcase ABC’s late-night host, Kimmel as usual brought the right light touch to the proceedings, while adding a bit of heft to his monologue by addressing the strikes that hobbled the industry and pausing to give the award-show crew their moment in the spotlight amid negotiations between the union that represents them (The International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employees) and the Alliance of Motion Picture and Television Producers.
                            In that sense, the court’s opinion was a significant victory for Trump, vanquishing a legal theory that has for months threatened his viability for a second term.</p>
