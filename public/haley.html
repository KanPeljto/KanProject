                    Former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley announced Wednesday she is suspending her presidential campaign following a series of losses on Super Tuesday.

                    <p>
                        “The time has now come to suspend my campaign. I said I wanted Americans to have their voices heard. I have done that. I have no regrets,” Haley said during remarks in Charleston, South Carolina, following a series of losses in GOP nominating contests on Super Tuesday.

                            <h5>The Supreme Court on Monday ruled that former President Donald Trump could not be removed from the ballot in Colorado or any other state – a sweeping and historic ruling that brushed aside a lawsuit claiming that he disqualified himself from office because of his actions on January 6, 2021.</h5>

                            Haley congratulated Trump in her address but did not endorse him.
                            
                            “I have always been a conservative Republican and always supported the Republican nominee, but on this question, as she did on so many others, Margaret Thatcher provided some good advice when she said, ‘Never just follow the crowd. Always make up your own mind,’” the former governor said. <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
                            
                            “It is now up to Donald Trump to earn the vote – those in our party and beyond it, who did not support him. And I hope he does that,” she said. Sources familiar with her plans told CNN prior to her speech that Haley’s approach appears to leave room for her to endorse Trump ahead of the general election.

                            Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday called for debates with President Joe Biden hours after Nikki Haley suspended her presidential campaign. Trump, who did not participate in any GOP primary debates, has previously said he wanted to debate Biden in the general election.
                               <br> <br> "It is important, for the Good of our Country, that Joe Biden and I Debate Issues that are so vital to America, and the American People. Therefore, I am calling for Debates, ANYTIME, ANYWHERE, ANYPLACE! The Debates can be run by the Corrupt DNC, or their Subsidiary, the Commission on Presidential Debates (CPD). I look forward to receiving a response. Thank you for your attention to this matter!" <br> <br>
                               Trump posted on Truth Social.
                              <br> <br> <br>
                            <br>
                            Biden's campaign responded, saying it’s a conversation they will have “at the appropriate time" and urged the former president to watch Biden's State of the Union address on Thursday. <br> <br>

                            "I know Donald Trump's thirsty for attention and struggling to expand his appeal beyond the MAGA base -- and that's a conversation we'll have at the appropriate time in this cycle," Michael Tyler, the campaign’s communications director, said in a statement.</p>
